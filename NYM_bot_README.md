# NYM_community_bot serves the following functions:

1. It provides information about the NYM project in different languages, including project descriptions, documentation links, installation scripts, and community Twitter links.

2. Users can request project-related information using slash commands such as `/project_description`, `/documentation`, `/installation_script`, and `/community_twitter`.

3. The bot determines the language preference of the user based on their Discord role and provides information in their preferred language if available. If the user's language is not supported, it defaults to English.

4. It operates within a Discord server and responds to user commands by sending appropriate project-related information in the requested language.

5. The bot is designed to be multilingual, accommodating users who speak English, German, and Greek, and can easily support additional languages by extending the `outputs` dictionary with relevant translations.
